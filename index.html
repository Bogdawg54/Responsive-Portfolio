			<h1> About Me </h1>
			
			<img src="assets/images/kitty.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			<p> I am currently enrolled in the Case Western Reserve University coding bootcamp. My end goal is to work as a full-stack web developer upon graduation. This has been a very challenging course, but I have enjoyed the process so far. I also currently hold a bachelors degree in Science of Health Sciences. I have always enjoyed human interaction as well as soling problems, so this is a great opportunity to use both skills.    </p>

			<p> I look forward to updating my porfolio as I learn new skills in coding. Hope you enjoy my portfolio! </p>
